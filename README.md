> * Project Title: Spreading of Scientific Ideas

## General Introduction

This project tries to model the scientific community regarding the spreading of ideas and research activity. Based on real publication data the spreading of ideas is compared to simulated data using university ranking and Journal Impact Factors as basis. Based on this first modell we than try to find other influences, aswell as to refine and describe the the properies in more detail.

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

The publication data: We are planning to get publication data including the title, abstract, autors and institutions. The words appearing in the title and abstract are than ranked and so we want go gather catchwords corresponding to new theories. Based on this the spreading of these ideas starting from their first appearance can be followed.

Spreading Parameters: For us, the university ranking and Journal Impact Factors are the two most obvious indicators how good a idea can be and how fast an idea will spread. Based on this the spreading can be simulated from a starting point given by the publication data and than compared to the real spreading.

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

Is the belonging to a Wold-Class university necessary to be able to produce a trough-breaking idea?
Do university ranking and Journal Impact Factors sufficie to model the impact of a new idea?
What other parameters influence the arising and the spreading of ideas?

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

???

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

???

The proposed Projects 27-30 would be good references.

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)
